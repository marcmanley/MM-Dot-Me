<h2 align="center">On the validity of <em>Ijtihad</em></h2>
  <h3 align="center">from the 
  viewpoint of <em>Usul</em> (principles of Islamic jurisprudence)</h3>
  <h4 align="center">by Mohammad Fadel</h4>
  <p><em>Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim, wa al-salat wa-l-salam 
  'ala muhammad wa 'ala alihi wa sahbihi wa azwajihi ajma'in.</em></p>
  <p><em>rabbi ishrah li sadri wa yassir li amri wa ahlul 'uqdatan 
  min lisani yafqahu qawli.</em></p>
  <p><em>Amma ba'd:</em></p>
  <p>We live in an age where we often 
  come across fatawa on contemporary issues which 
  require ijtihad, without knowing the authority/qualification of the one issuing, so I was just wondering: <ol><li>What 
  qualifies an ijtihad as being valid?</li></ol></p>
  <p>Before one can answer this question, one must understand 
  there the scholars of <em>usul al-fiqh</em> have identified at least three types 
  of <em>ijtihad</em>:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><em>takhrij al-manat</em>;</li>
  <li><em>tanqih al-manat</em>; and</li>
  <li><em>tahqiq al-manat</em></li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p><em>Takhrij al-manat</em> roughly means &quot;extraction of 
  the grounds [of a divine ruling]. An obvious example would be that the grounds 
  for the prohibition of <em>khamr</em> (grape wine) is its capacity to intoxicate. 
  While this example is obvious, other texts of revelation prove much more 
  difficult in the extraction of the <em>manat</em>, and hence, the mujtahids have 
  differed greatly in their opinions regarding the grounds of the divine ruling. 
  [note: &quot;<em>manat</em>&quot; when used in the context of <em>takhrij al-manat</em> 
  is virtually synonymous with the term &quot;<em>'illa</em>. &quot; Of course, 
  the scholars of <em>usul al-fiqh</em> have identified various types of <em>'illas</em> 
  of differing strength, something I am only superficially familiar with. A good 
  source discussing this question is Imam al-Ghazali's &quot;<em>Shifa</em>` <em>al-ghalil 
  fi masalik al'ta'lil</em>,&quot; wherein the Imam discusses the various types 
  of <em>'illas</em> and their use in juridical analogy (<em>qiyas</em>). <em>Wa-allahu 
  a'lam.</em></p>
  <p>Because <em>takhrij al-manat</em> requires proper 
  understand of the indicants of the divine ruling (the <em>dalil</em>), it is 
  this type of ijtihad that requires mastery of the full spectrum of religious 
  sciences with the additional stipulation of <em>'adala</em> and piety. 
  Obviously, the minimum required is that the mujtahid know all the proof texts 
  that are relevant to solving the question before him, and that there is no 
  unequivocal divine communication (<em>khitab</em>) governing the case. [Note: 
  there are three types of &quot;<em>dalil</em>&quot; of a divine ruling, Qur'an, 
  sunna and consensus. With the exception of the Qur'an, the different mujtahids 
  had different opinions with regard to the manner in which the other two <em>dalils</em> 
  had to be transmitted so as to constitute a valid <em>dalil</em>].</p>
  <p>I believe Sidi Haddad only recently posted on the 
  attributes of a <em>mujtahid mutlaq</em>, i.e., that scholar who is qualified to 
  issue religious opinions on any matter based on his direct interpretation of 
  divine revelation. It is commonly accepted that no one satisfies these 
  requirements today.</p>
  <p>While this is erroneously claimed to be a defect, in 
  fact, because we have the legacy of the mujtahid-imams, the advanced students 
  of these Imams, by following the doctrines of their Imams, are able to derive 
  rulings for unprecedented cases rather easily. Indeed, according to Ibn 
  al-Salah, it is easier for the <em>muqallid</em> of an Imam to arrive at a 
  ruling on an unprecedented case by relying on the principles of his Imam than 
  it would be to derive the rule solely on the <em>dalils</em> of <em>shar'</em>, <em>wa-allahu 
  a'lam</em>. This level of scholar is deemed <em>mujtahid fi-l-madhhab</em> (a 
  mujtahid within a madhhab).</p>
  <p>[also &quot;<em>mujtahid muntasib</em> = affiliated 
  mujtahid&quot;) GFH:. ]</p>
  <p>The second type of ijtihad<em>, tanqih al-manat</em>, is an 
  intermediary step preceding <em>takhrij al-manat</em>, where the mujtahid, 
  working as a scientist does, confronts a <em>dalil</em>, and hypothesizes that 
  the ground for the rule contained in the <em>dalil</em> is X, Y or Z. He then 
  tests this hypothesis against other data to see if the theory is sound. The 
  mujtahid continues doing this until he determines which of X, Y or Z, or a 
  combination of them, is the actual ground for the rule.</p>
  <p>It seems to me that at this stage of ijtihad, 
  non-specialists in religious sciences have a critical, though ancillary role, 
  to play in aiding the mujtahid's inquiry. Often, when a mujtahid is attempting 
  to determine whether the <em>'illa</em> is X, Y or Z, he will rely on some 
  empirical theory, especially if the mujtahid believes that the <em>'illa</em> 
  should be &quot;appropriate (<em>munasib</em>)&quot; to the ruling. Appropriate 
  in this case means that it serves one of the five <em>maqasid kulliyya</em> 
  [comprehensive objectives] of the Shari'a, i.e.,</p>
  <p>[1] the promotion of religion,</p>
  <p>[2] the protection and/or enhancement of life,</p>
  <p>[3] property,</p>
  <p>[4] progeny and</p>
  <p>[5] reason (<em>'aql</em>). </p>
  <p>Where a fatwa incorporates an empirical judgment, the 
  mufti must take steps to ensure that the empirical judgment he is adopting is 
  not clearly erroneous.</p>
  <p>Finally, <em>tahqiq al-manat</em> is that type of ijtihad 
  concerned with accurate perception of the empirical world. Allah, subhanahu wa 
  ta'ala, in His mercy, obliged us to worship Him only conditionally, i.e., when 
  certain conditions are met. Likewise, in His mercy, He also removes certain 
  obligations from us when certain impediments exist. The conditions whereby an 
  act becomes obligatory is called a &quot;<em>sabab</em>,&quot; and a condition 
  whereby an obligation is suspended is called a &quot;<em>mani'</em>&quot;, 
  literally, &quot;an obstacle. &quot;A common example of a <em>sabab</em> is the 
  sun reaching its zenith in the sky being the condition for the obligation to 
  pray <em>zuhr</em>. An obstacle removing the obligation of Pilgrimage would be, 
  at least for Malikis, an absence of secure carriage to the Hijaz. In other 
  situations, the divine rule itself requires the application of some empirical 
  knowledge, e.g., facing the <em>qibla</em> at the time of prayer, or in the 
  circumstance of the destruction of private property, an empirical 
  determination of its fair market value.</p>
  <p>The point is simply that in many situations, properly 
  obeying Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala requires making an accurate determination of 
  an empirical situation, and this type of knowledge is not necessarily within 
  the preserve of a mujtahid, unless he is also, independently of his mastery of 
  religious sciences, also a master of the particular empirical science at issue.</p>
  <p>Al-Qarafi gives a good example of an empirical error 
  underlying Imam Malik's (may Allah be please with him!) opinion regarding the 
  beginning of the lunar months in the Islamic calendar. The <em>mashhur</em> of 
  the madhhab is that once the moon is seen anywhere, the month begins for the 
  entire Muslim community. This position is known as &quot;<em>ittihad al-matali'</em>. 
  &quot;The other position, adopted by the Shafi'is, at least according to al-Qarafi, 
  is that each town has its own moon, i.e., months begin and end according to 
  local moonsightings. Qarafi explains, however, that Malik's position was based 
  on the erroneous empirical theory that the moon was visible at the same time 
  everywhere. Al-Qarafi, being trained in astronomy, knew this to be 
  false, and stated that the position of the moon relative to human observers 
  varies depending upon the position of the human observer, and therefore, the 
  Shafi'i position is correct. (See, <em>al-Furuq, al-farq al-awwal, al-farq 
  bayna al-riwaya wa-l-shahada</em>).</p>
  <p>Thus, as a general matter, one can say that any fatwa 
  that is based on an empirical premise known to be wrong is itself certainly 
  wrong, although the pure rule that the mujtahid relied on in issuing his 
  opinion may nonetheless be sound.</p>
  <p>[The <em>Matali</em>` or visible moon positions per Malik 
  and the Hanafi School are unified in effect for Ramadan and Shawwal on the 
  grounds - Allah knows best - not of the empirical theory that the moon should 
  be visible at the same time everywhere, but the explicit wording of the 
  Prophet (saws) said to &quot;fast at its sighting and cease fasting at its 
  sighting&quot; in absolute sighting terms, i.e. no matter where, <u>one</u> 
  true sighting sufficing for the whole Umma, - which is what is meant by <em>ittihad 
  al-Matali</em>` - and this is why Ramadan and `Eid al-Fitr are or should be 
  unified. This is the agreement of the Four Schools according the Jedda-based 
  International Fiqh Council including the Shafi`i Ulema such as the late Shaykh 
  Mustafa al-Zarqa, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Dr. Wahbe al-Zuhayli. . . 
  so the present orientation of the Umma has endorsed the fatwa of Imam Malik 
  after all, regardless of his or the Hanafi Imams' knowledge in astronomy. 
  Whereas for Dhul Hijja the <em>Matali</em>` must be precisely differentiated in 
  every respective area and it is therefore allowed that their respective dates 
  for `Eid al-Adha differ<em>. WAllahu a`lam</em>. G. F. Haddad. 
  ]</p>
  <p>Another example might make this more clear:according to 
  Imam Malik, any land that the Muslims conquered by force is <em>waqf</em>, and 
  therefore, not eligible to be privately owned. Imam Malik also gave the fatwa 
  that the land of Egypt was a <em>waqf</em> based on the historical (empirical) 
  assumption that Egypt had been conquered, not that it had voluntarily (<em>sulh</em>) 
  entered Islam. Qarafi points out that whether Egypt was or was not 
  conquered is a matter of <em>shahada</em> (empirical knowledge) not <em>riwaya</em> 
  (transmission of revelatory knowledge), and therefore, Imam Malik's opinion on 
  this empirical fact is not an appropriate object of <em>taqlid</em>. Indeed, 
  others, e.g., al-Layth b. Sa'ad, who were closer to events, who reported 
  the opposite, are more worthy to be believed, not because their knowledge of 
  revelation exceeded that of Malik, but rather that their specialized empirical 
  knowledge regarding the circumstances whereby the territory of Egypt entered 
  Islamic dominion is more accurate than that of Malik.</p>
  <p>One can conclude by a general observation. Allah 
  subhanahu wa ta'ala has blessed this umma by making His commands consistent 
  with reason (<em>'aql</em>), the attribute by which He distinguished the 
  descendants of Adam, 'alayhi al-salam, from the rest of His creation. 
  Accordingly, we Muslims, when called upon to exercise our mental process in 
  the process of obeying our Creator, are always obliged to follow the <b><u>best</u></b> 
  information we can find. Thus, as non-specialists in the revelatory sciences, 
  we know that the opinions of the mujtahid-Imams are superior to the opinions 
  of the unlearned, and accordingly, we follow their opinions, not those of the 
  uninformed. Likewise, we also know that mujtahid imams are not necessarily the 
  best source of information on empirical matters, and accordingly, where our 
  worship of Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, requires ascertaining that a certain 
  empirical circumstance be confirmed, or negated, we must rely on experts in 
  that empirical field for that piece of information.</p>
  <p>In short, valid ijtihad consists in following the best 
  available evidence, whether that evidence is revelatory or empirical, as the 
  context requires<em>. Wa-allahu 'alam.</em></p>
  
  <p>Ø<span style="font-family:Arial">2. 
  Surely it takes more than just exercising a level of effort/exertion tobeconsidered 
  ijtihad? It seems that today, many of the fatawa we come across are 
  not quite to the standards 
  of Classical excellence. So are they still considered ijtihads, and can they at least 
  claim the single reward of an erroneous ijtihad?</p>
  <p>I think I answered this question implicitly in the 
  discussion above. I would only add this: the decline in quality of fatawa is 
  only a particular manifestation of the more general decline of Muslims in all 
  fields of learning. Moreover, one can only express astonishment at a people 
  who used to compete with one another in the acquisition of learning, but today 
  lead the world in illiteracy!The lack of respect for learning today in the 
  Muslim world is surely a sign (and cause) of Allah's anger with us. I ask Him 
  to rekindle in our hearts the love of learning and respect for those who 
  pursue it.</p>
  
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">3. 
  Is the concept of *wrong/erroneous ijtihad* an oxymoron?</p>
  <p>The <em>fuqaha</em>` and the <em>mutakillimun</em> have 
  differences of opinion on this question. This is an advanced topic in usul al-fiqh, 
  and I do not wish to speak in great detail on this question, although I am 
  happy to discuss it privately. The gist of the dispute is reported in al-Ghazali's 
  Mustasfa, where he asks the question whether a divine rule exists for every 
  event. The <em>fuqaha</em>` say yes, the <em>mutakillimun</em> say no, 
  or at least the majority of them say no. Clearly, if one adopts the position 
  of the <em>fuqaha</em>`, erroneous ijtihad makes sense. If one adopts the 
  position of the <em>mutakillimun</em> (known as the &quot;<em>musawwiba</em>&quot;), 
  all mujtahids are correct, assuming they've done their duty, i.e., used their 
  best efforts in arriving at their conclusion.</p>
  <p>[Al-Nawawi said: &quot;Every mujtahid is correct 
  according to one of the two views on the issue. &quot; - Al-Nawawi in <em>Sharh 
  Sahih Muslim</em>, Chapter entitled <em>Al-Amr bi al-Ma`ruf wa al-Nahy `an al-Munkar</em>, 
  commentary on the hadith of the Prophet (saws): &quot;Whoever of you sees 
  wrongdoing, let him change it with his hand; if he cannot, then with his 
  tongue; if he cannot, then with his heart, and that is the weakest belief. 
  &quot; Of course what is meant here by &quot;every mujtahid&quot; is every 
  qualified mujtahid. As for an unqualified mujtahid, the Prophet (saws) 
  said: &quot;Whoever explains the Qur'an with his mere opinion, let him from 
  now take his seat in the Fire. &quot; GFH]</p>
  
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">4. 
  How is a weak ijtihad differentiated from an erroneous 
  (i.e. wrongijtihad)?</p>
  <p>Except where ijtihad is based on a demonstrably erroneous 
  premise, it cannot be categorically wrong in the sense that it is invalid. 
  Practically speaking, &quot;weak&quot; ijtihad is differentiated from 
  &quot;strong&quot; ijtihad on the basis of the numbers of persons following it. 
  Nevertheless, weak opinions are still transmitted within the madhhabs, and 
  they may become the preferred rule given certain circumstances. In other 
  words, &quot;weak&quot; opinions often serve as the basis of a legitimate 
  fatwa when certain empirical circumstances are deemed pressing enough to 
  justify a departure from the normal rule. This is close to the distinction 
  between a <em>rukhsa</em> and <em>'azima</em>. Sometimes, the circumstances are 
  general, in which case the weak opinion becomes the going opinion of the 
  school and (temporarily) displaces the well-established opinion (<em>al-mashhur</em>), 
  while at other times, the fatwa can be given to a particular person based on 
  the questioner's own private circumstances. An example of the former is 
  Malik's opinion that a woman cannot obtain a <em>khul'</em> separation in 
  exchange for relieving the father of the duty to provide for his children. 
  Despite this being the <em>mashhur</em> of the Madhhab, later Andalusi Malikis 
  enforced separation agreements on these terms based on changed circumstances. 
  There are many such instances in all the madhahib, and these rulings are 
  usually prefaced by statements such as &quot;<em>wa 'alayhi al-'amal</em>,&quot; 
  or &quot;<em>huwa al-mufta bihi</em>,&quot; or &quot;<em>al-maqdi bihi</em>&quot; 
  to distinguish it from the <em>mashhur</em> of the madhhab.</p>
  <p><em>Wa-allahu a'lam.</em></p>
  <p>[An example of the replacement of the <em>mashhur</em> - 
  established - position by a weaker position in the Maliki madhhab is the 
  prevalent fatwa that, for practical reasons, it is not necessary to pray Zuhr 
  after Jumu`a even if the latter was not the &quot;main Jumu`a&quot; i.e. the 
  categorically valid Jumu`a in a given region. References:</p>
  <p>Ibn Juzay, <em>al-Qawanin al-Fiqhiyya</em> (p. 56): 
  &quot;Concerning Salat al-Jumu`a in two mosques in a single province (<em>misr</em>) 
  there are three sayings: the third one distinguishes whether or not a river 
  separates the two mosques or something that stands like it (<em>ma fi ma`nah</em>). 
  If we say that it is not allowed, then the valid Jumu`a is that of the oldest 
  mosque. &quot;</p>
  <p><em>Mukhtasar Khalil</em> (p. 45): &quot;Section on 
  Exposing the Conditions of [Validity for] Salat al-Jumu`a: . . . and in 
  a convening mosque (<em>jami</em>`) constructed (<em>mabni</em>), all-inclusive (<em>muttahid</em>), 
  and the [valid] Jumu`a is that of the older one (<em>al-jumu`a lil-`atiq</em>) 
  even if it is prayed later. &quot;</p>
  <p><em>Al-Taj wa al-Iklil li Mukhtasar Khalil </em>by al-`Abdari 
  (2:159-160): &quot;<em>Al-Jumu`a li al-`atiq</em> (Jumu`a prayer counts in the 
  older mosque): al-Jallab: Jumu`a is not prayed in a single province (<em>misr</em>) 
  in two mosques. If they do, then the [valid] salat is the salat of the 
  people who pray in the older mosque. Abu Muhammad said: If they pray in 
  two mosques, then Jumu`a is for whoever prays in the older one, whether the 
  Ruler (al-imam) prays there or in the newer. &quot;</p>
  <p>Al-Dardir, <em>al-Sharh al-Kabir</em> (1:372, 374): 
  &quot;Chapter: Exposition of the Conditions of validity for Salat al-Jumu`a 
  etc. . . . [It must be] 'all-inclusive' (<em>muttahid</em>): If there are 
  more than one, it is not valid for each one. 'The [valid] Jumu`a prayer 
  is that of the older' [mosque] i.e. the one in which the Jumu`a was first 
  prayer, even if its construction came later. . . . &quot;</p>
  <p>Al-Dusuqi's <em>Hashiya</em> (1:374): &quot;'All-inclusive' 
  i.e. it is not permissible to have several according to the <em>mashhur</em> 
  position, even if the region (<em>al-balad</em>) is large, in keeping with the 
  way of the Salaf and so as to reunite all and obtain lucidity of hearts (<em>jala' 
  al-sudur</em>). On the other hand there is the saying of Yahya ibn `Umar 
  permitting multiple ones [Jumu`as] if the region is large; AND THIS HAS BEEN 
  PUT INTO PRACTICE. His saying: <em>'wal-Jumu`a lil-`atiq'</em>: i.e. it is 
  not valid in the new mosque even if the Sultan prays in it. . . &quot; GFH]</p>
  
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">5. Can one who is less 
  than the rank of mujtahid, undertake ijtihad? For example, 
  I know of no mujtahids today, yet we see &quot;ijtihads&quot; on novel matters like 
  cloning, etc. Do these constitute &quot;ijtihad&quot;?</p>
  <p>It should be done within the principles of an established 
  madhhab, <em>wa-allahu a'lam.</em></p>
  
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">6. 
  Since ijtihad is (surely) a necessary tool in every age, then if we lack mujtahideen, are 
  the conditions for undertaking ijtihad 
  relaxed de jure? Like today, do we have people who are not mujtahids, undertaking ijtihad? And if so, how is this 
  valid, i.e. upon what basis? The basis 
  of necessity? That we have 
  no other option in the absence of mujtahideen?</p>
  <p>This has 
  already been answered, I think.</p>
  
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">7. 
  Can an ijtihad precede a claim to being a mujtahid? 
  Like today, we see claims 
  to ijtihad by some who are unknown - either widely, or at all - for it 
  to be verifiable that they 
  have indeed reached this capacity. So how then do they 
  make the claim? I 
  have heard such proponents argue that the quality of the output (i.e. 
  the ijtihad) will reflect the calibre of the one who produced it, and thereby one 
  can recognise that this 
  must have been a mujtahid. To me, this seems like placing the cart before the horse, for why should we even 
  entertain a claim to a valid ijtihad until and unless we know the credentials 
  of the one purporting to make the claim either themself, or on behalf 
  of the one who supposed ijtihad we are being asked to accept? Is my supposition 
  correct here?</p>
  <p>One should never accept an opinion of someone without 
  knowing the credentials of the person giving the opinion. <em>Taqlid</em> is 
  permissible only where the opinion is &quot;qualified&quot; opinion. <em>Wa-allahu 
  a'lam.</em></p>
  <p>Ø 
  <span style="font-family:Arial">8. 
  What is the difference between a fatwa, a <em>hukm</em>, and <em>qada</em>? And is every <em>hukm</em> that 
  is *derived* a necessary product of ijtihad? If so, then it seems 
  prima facie that anyone who 
  issues a fatwa on a *new matter* has made 
  an implicit claim to ijtihad, no? Which also then pre-supposes the 
  rank of mujtahid, no? (Unless 
  of course you answered question no. 5 by saying that the rules have changed in our 
  times, because we lack mujtahideen, yet 
  still need to undertake ijtihad. )</p>
  <p>For those on this list who can read Arabic, I commend to 
  them the book of Imam al-Qarafi with the title, &quot;<em>al-Ihkam fi tamyiz 
  al-fatawa 'an al-ahkam wa tasarrufat al-qadi wa-l-imam</em>. &quot;There is an 
  excellent Syrian edition of this work which, I believe, was edited by Shaykh 
  Abu Ghudda, rahimahu allah. Unfortunately, many of its examples are 
  technical and required familiarity with the detailed rulings of the Maliki 
  school. For those of you who are interested in this subject, Professor Sherman 
  (Abdalhakim) Jackson has written extensively on Imam al-Qarafi in English, and 
  has a good discussion of this work. He has an article with the title 
  &quot;From Prophetic Actions to Constitutional Theory,&quot; which appears in 
  the International Journal of Middle East Studies, I think circa 1995 or 1996, 
  and he also has a book by the title of &quot;Islamic Law and the State: The 
  Constitutional Jurisprudence of Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi. &quot;Although very 
  expensive, it should be available in the campus libraries of major research 
  institutions.</p>
  <p>At any rate, the primary difference between a fatwa and a 
  <em>qada</em> is that the latter is binding and the former is not. Only a 
  government official with <em>wilaya</em> can issue a <em>qada</em>`. Although the 
  rule used by the judge is substantively the same as the rule used by the 
  mufti, the fact that the judge enjoys <em>wilaya</em> means that his opinion, 
  although it is only an opinion, carries with it coercive effect (<em>ilzam 
  hissi</em>), whereas the fatwa, because it is only an opinion and there is no 
  political <em>wilaya</em> associated with it, relies solely on the good faith of 
  the <em>mustafti</em> (the petitioner) to comply with its terms. A <em>qada</em> 
  is also distinguished from a fatwa in terms of its scope -- although a <em>qada</em> 
  is coercively binding, meaning it is obligatory to obey it (the <em>fuqaha'</em> 
  describe it as &quot;removing the controversy (<em>yarfa' al-khilaf</em>,&quot; 
  thereby rendering the ruling as though it were a subject of consensus 
  [Consensus being universally binding GFH]), it applies <b><u>exclusively</u>/b> 
  to the parties in the dispute and no one else. A fatwa, however, applies to 
  everyone until the Day of Judgment, with the limitation that no one has to 
  obey it as a matter of force.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, a judicial ruling, <em>qada</em>`, can be 
  intermingled with a fatwa, in which case, only that portion of the judge's 
  decision which is necessary to resolve the dispute is binding, and the rest 
  remains a fatwa. For example, while all the four schools agree that a 
  marriage contracted during a woman's <em>'idda</em> is invalid, the Maliki 
  position goes further and holds that when this occurs, the two are <b><u>forever</u></b> 
  forbidden to marry one another. Suppose a man marries a woman during her <em>'idda</em>, 
  and the case comes before a Maliki judge. He declares their marriage invalid, 
  and proclaims that it is <em>haram</em> for them ever to be remarried. The 
  parties separate pursuant to the judge's decree that the marriage is invalid, 
  and this ruling, because it is a qada<em>`,</em> must be respected by all, i.e., 
  no one can give a fatwa that the couple is still married. But, suppose, after 
  the woman goes through her <em>'idda</em>, in violation of the judge's command 
  that it is <em>haram</em> for them to remarry, they do get remarried. What is 
  the status of their second marriage?Suppose the case is brought before a 
  Shafi'i judge. He will rule that the marriage is valid, except that they have 
  already gone through one divorce. The earlier ruling by the Maliki that they 
  are forever forbidden to each other will be treated merely as a fatwa. Suppose 
  instead, however, that they again went to a Maliki judge. In this case, if he 
  ruled that the marriage was invalid, as he would, the Maliki rule that they 
  are forever prohibited from marrying one another would no longer be a fatwa, 
  but is instead a <em>qada</em>`, and no one could challenge the conclusion that 
  they are forever prohibited from one another. Indeed, if they subsequently 
  attempted to remarry, they might be deemed fornicators.</p>
  <p>Every <em>qada</em>` is necessarily based on <em>ijtihad</em>, 
  although it is the <em>ijtihad</em> based on empirical knowledge. 
  Knowledge of the appropriate rules to apply in a given dispute can be gained 
  from following the opinions of the <em>mujtahid</em> imam.</p>
  <p>The term &quot;<em>hukm</em>&quot; is equivocal, and can 
  imply either &quot;<em>hukm allah</em>,&quot; which is a <em>fatwa</em>, because 
  of its generality, or &quot;<em>hukm al-hakim</em>,&quot; in which case it means 
  the <em>qada</em>` of a government official, e.g., a judge. Not all acts 
  of government officials that are binding, however, are &quot;<em>qada</em>`&quot; 
  or &quot;<em>hukm</em>. &quot;Remember, the distinguishing feature of a <em>qada</em>` 
  is that it removes disagreement and settles the question forever. </p>
  <p>When the government decides to seize a piece of property 
  for a public purpose, for example, this is called a <em>tasarruf</em>, because 
  the government can change its mind! These discretionary acts of governments 
  are valid insofar as they don't clearly order an act that is <em>haram</em>, and 
  they increase the welfare of the community (<em>yajlib al-ahsan/al-aslah</em>) 
  [Note: where the government seizes private property for a public purpose, it 
  is obliged to compensate the owner the fair market value of the property so 
  taken]. Thus, when a government establishes a college, for example, and states 
  that admission is conditional upon achieving a certain score on a certain 
  test, that is a <em>tasarruf</em>, because it does not resolve any dispute about 
  the meaning of revelation in the context of a private dispute, and subsequent 
  governments are perfectly free to change the criteria of admission so long as 
  by doing so, they believe the status quo will be improved. <em>Tasarruf</em>, 
  however, is a type of <em>ijtihad</em>, but it is <em>ijtihad</em> in the 
  empirical domain, not the domain of revelation, and therefore, it is more 
  particularly in the domain of empirical and technical specialists.</p>
  <p>The Prophet (s) stated that whosoever becomes entrusted 
  with some aspect of the public welfare of the Muslim community, and fails to 
  discharge that duty using sincerity (<em>nasiha</em>), and is unconcerned about 
  improving their lot, then <em>janna</em> is forbidden to him, we ask Allah to 
  guide us and preserve us. Given that, it is amazing that the countries of the 
  Muslims are rife with public corruption!Private virtue will not avail someone 
  who is betraying the <em>amana</em> of the Muslims in his public office by 
  exploiting his position to shower favors on friends and family (<em>muhaba</em>). 
  Public corruption has become so entrenched in Egypt that, according to a 
  recent story related to me by one in whom I place trust, a government 
  official, not necessarily a minister, took as his bribe a ticket to perform 'umra!<em>Inna 
  li-llahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un</em>.</p>
  <p>Our master 'Umar stated that it is necessary to pay 
  judges a hefty salary so that they are not tempted to seek or accept bribes. 
  Yet, we pay our public officials so little that they must demand bribes to 
  feed their families. There is no doubt that our failure to have rational 
  systems of administration is a great failing and we will be answerable for it 
  on the day of Judgment, just as we shall be answereable for all other <em>furud</em> 
  <em>kifaya</em> that we are remiss in, <em>wa-allahu al-musta'an.</em></p>

  What is the difference between a <em>mujtahid</em>, a <em>mufti</em>, a <em>faqih</em>, an <em>'alim</em>, and 
  a <em>qadi</em>?</p>
  <p>This depends on the genre and the period in which the 
  term is being used. 'Alim, however, applies generally to any person with 
  knowledge of Allah. Faqih came to be used exclusively for the persons with 
  knowledge of the rules that apply to Muslims in this life. See <em>Ihya` ulum 
  al-din, kitab al-'ilm</em>, by al-Ghazali. The rules of fiqh, though important, 
  are only a means to an end, and <em>fuqaha</em>`, according to al-Ghazali, 
  practice a worldly science, akin to the mission of physicians. Their 
  science is a necessary condition for salvation, but not a sufficient one. 
  Essentially, the role of fiqh is to ensure that the world is sufficiently 
  secure to allow you reach your destination (Allah) safely.</p>
  <p>A <em>qadi</em> is a <em>faqih</em> who has been appointed by 
  the government to resolve disputes among people according to the rules of 
  Islam as developed by the mujtahid imams and their followers, whereas a mufti 
  communicates the rules of Islam, according to his own interpretation, if he is 
  a <em>mujtahid mutlaq</em>, or according to his Imam, if he is a muqallid, in a 
  manner that is non-binding (in the secular sense).</p>

  Can we take fatawa from (i) anonymous sources, and/or (ii) entities, and/or 
  (iii) those who don't agree that one requires ijaza to be able to undertake 
  ijtihad? Like for example, a fatwa issued by a group, that provides 
  no names of who 
  produced the fatwa? Or, say, an article which examines the fiqh of a particular issue - and may even quote 
  authorities - yet again is not attributed to 
  a person, but an entity. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:2.25pt"></p>
  <p>I think this would depend upon the circumstances. 
  Remember the first principle articulated above -- you must follow the best 
  evidence available. Also, you could avoid these issues simply by avoiding 
  speculation on matters that are merely hypothetical. Remember the hadith 
  of Rasulallah (s) prohibiting his umma from incessant questioning on matters 
  that do not concern them.</p>
  <p>Finally, it is haram to follow a fatwa permitting you to 
  do something if you think it is wrong to do the questionable act. The Prophet 
  (S) said to follow the fatwa of your heart even if the people give you fatwas 
  to the contrary.</p>

  Is it possible to attain the rank of mujtahid without obtaining <em>ijazas</em>?</p>
  <p>I don't know whether this is a formal consideration. 
  The point is that the mufti should have 'ilm. <em>Ijazas</em> are evidence of 
  possessing <em>'ilm</em>. Whether they are the exclusive means of demonstrating 
  the requisite <em>'ilm</em> is another question.</p>

  Can someone self-declare a claim to being a mujtahid, and that be acceptedfrom 
  their peers? For example, I have heard it said about Imam Suyuti (ra) that he 
  considered himself a mujtahid, <em>wallahu a'lam. </em></p>
  <p>[It is questionable whether Imam al-Suyuti actually meant 
  he <u>was</u> a <em>mujtahid mutlaq</em> although he did claim <u>being 
  qualified</u> to be one: &quot;I did not mean by this that I was similar to 
  one of the Four Imams, but only that I was a School-affiliated mujtahid (<em>mujtahid 
  muntasib</em>). For, when I reached the level of <em>tarjih</em> or 
  distinguishing the best fatwa inside the school, I did not contravene al-Nawawi's 
  <em>tarjih</em>. And when I reached the level of <em>ijtihad mutlaq</em>, I 
  did not contravene al-Shafi`i's school. &quot; He continued: &quot;There is 
  not in our time, on the face of the earth, from East to West, anyone more 
  knowledgeable than myself in hadith and the Arabic language, save al-Khidr or 
  the Pole of saints or some other <em>wali</em> - none of whom I include in my 
  statement - and Allah knows best. &quot; Al-Suyuti, <em>al-Radd `ala man 
  Akhlada ila al-Ard wa Jahila anna al-Ijtihada fi kulli `Asrin Fard</em> 
  (&quot;Refutation of the Shiftless Who Have no Idea that Ijtihad is a 
  Religious Obligation in Every Age&quot;) (p. 116). GFH]</p>
  <p>People can say whatever they want. Allah, subhanahu 
  wa ta'ala, however, says &quot;<em>wa qul: ja`a al-haqqu wa zahaqa al-batil. 
  inna al-batila kana zuhuqa. </em>&quot;In another verse which I do not have 
  memorized, Allah tells us that He throws truth against falsehood, destroying 
  the former, and preserving the latter. Likewise, another ayat speaks of 
  Allah's preserving that which is useful and destroying that which is not. 
  Accordingly, the proof of the pudding is in the tasting, not in declaring it 
  to be pudding. Whether someone is or is not a mujtahid is irrelevant. 
  What is relevant is whether that person's opinions are sound and consistent 
  with Allah's will, and wherever it is, the umma of Muhammd (S) will recognize 
  it, and benefit from it, inshallah. <em>Wa-allahu a'lam.</em></p>
