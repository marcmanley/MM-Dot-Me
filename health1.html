				<p><img src="media/imgs/manley-bio-shot-2.jpg" alt="Marc Manley" width="100"> There's no such thing as a diet. That's what I believe. There can only be lifestyle changes. 
					Over the past three years I have managed to lose about 60 pounds. I have been asked what is it I'm doing to achieve these results. I can assure you, it's not magic. 
					This has been accomplished through a number of means, some of which I thought I'd share here. Most importantly, I have not given up even when I haven't adhered 
					perfectly to this regiment: if I eat out with friends or family, I enjoy myself. My main goal is to remain vigilant Monday through Friday. That has brought me the 
					best results thus far.</p>
			</div>
				<ol style="clear: both; margin: 0 0 15px 0; padding: 15px 0 0 0;">
					<li>God's grace. Without a doubt.</li>
					<li>Cutting out (or at the very least, greatly reducing) refined sugar (white sugar, brown sugar, (fructose) corn syrup, etc. This is a major challenge since 
					just about everything has refinde sugar: bread, bagels, coffee drinks, pasta sauces. You name it. Do you best.</li>
					<li>Dramatically increase water consumption. This should be tied in with Step 9.</li>
					<li>Apple Cider Vinegar: I use a brand called <a href="http://bragg.com/products/bragg-organic-apple-cider-vinegar.html">Braggs</a> but any will do. Twice-a-day, 
						8oz. mixed with 2tbs. of apple cider vinegar. One in the morning, one before bed.</li>
					<li>Avoid eating after 7/8PM at night. This will vastly improve metabolism and rest. This is hard as many of us (I consider myself part of "us") love to keep eating and snacking 
					well into the night. This kills your body's ability to one, properly digest, and as a result, two, rest and repair damage.</li>
					<li>Reduce alcohol consumption (for my non-Muslim friends and family). Do not drink to "relieve stress". Read something beneficial or engage in some other beneficial activity.</li>
					<li>Increase fiber intake to 25 — 50g a day. Try to achieve most of this through leafy green's. Add a supplement if necessary (see <a href="http://altmedicine.about.com/od/weight_Loss/a/Pgx.htm">PGX fiber</a>).</li>
					<li>Avoid fruit juices; instead, actually eat fruit itself (this will help you achieve Step 7). Most fruit juice, even natural or organic, contains mostly sugar and no fiber and many are just empty calories.</li>
					<li>Set your alarm to 90 minute intervals for a break. Get up have 8 ounces of water and take a 5 to 10 minute walk, even if it's only around your office. Take the stairs and not the elevator. 
						Doing this while at work can reap tremendous benefits over the months.</li>
					<li>Don't give up! Stay consistent for 6 to 12 months. Don't let slipping for one or even two days cause you to quit.</li>
					<li>Daily activity: walking, biking, etc. Get some amount of daily excercise, no matter how small, so long as it's regular (daily!).</li>
				</ol>

سُئِلَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَىُّ الأَعْمَالِ أَحَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ ‏‏ أَدْوَمُهَا وَإِنْ قَلَّ
					
				</p>
				<blockquote>The Prophet Muhammad was asked, "What deeds are loved most by God?" He said, "The most regular constant deeds even though they may be few." </blockquote>
				<p class="arabic">
					
					اكْلَفُوا مِنَ الأَعْمَالِ مَا تُطِيقُونَ
				</p>
				<blockquote>He also added, "Don't take upon yourselves, except the deeds which are within your ability." <span style="font-style: normal;">&mdash; Narrated by A'ishah. Sahih al-Bukhari, #6465.</span></blockquote>
				<p>As I said above, don't berate yourself should you miss a day or even two. This objective is to not make these commitments a burden on you, but rather to give you a better quality of life.</p>
