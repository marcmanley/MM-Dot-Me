				Zakah
			</h2>
            
            <p>Let's do some quick math on <em>Zakah</em>. And let’s assume the average American family can get by with $30,000 per year. So, if 2.5% of $58 billion is $1.45 billion, how many families could be housed, fed, and educated for one year? That’s 48,333 families!, <strong>not individuals</strong>.</p>

            <p>Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world, currently worth $58 billion. Imagine if he gave away 2.5% of his money to the poor people of America. How many people could that help?</p>
            
            <p>Assuming each family consisted of 2 children and 2 adults. That brings to total number of people to 193,333. That’s more people than the entire population of Orlando. This is amazing! One man could literally care for an entire city of poor people.</p>
            
            <h3>Two Types of Zakah</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Zakah al-Mal</li>
                <li>Zakah al-Fitr</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The first type is called <strong>Zakah al-Mal</strong>. It is paid on wealth accumulated wealth over a year.</p>
            
            <p>It’s not based on earnings like income tax. Instead, the amount to be paid is based on whatever amount of wealth a person has in their possession. This would usually entail savings, gold and silver jewelry, stocks, produce, cash, livestock, etc. Those Muslims that fall below a certain wealth threshold, called <em>nisab</em>, are excused.</p>
            
            <p>The second type is Zakah al-Fitr. This must be paid by all Muslims with enough food for one day. Zakat al Fitr is paid by the head of the household on behalf of all family members, both young and old. The amount for Zakat al Fitr varies, but in the United States it usually ranges between $5 to $8 per person. This is due before the Salah for Eid al-Fitr.</p>
            
            <h3>Who Receives The Zakah?</h3>
            
            <p>Zakah cannot be paid to just any charitable cause. The recipients of Zakah are made clear in both the Qur'an and the statements of Prophet ﷺ  peace be upon him.</p>
            
            <p>Zakah can be given to people in the following categories:</p>
            
            <ul style="list-style: disc">
                <li><strong>The Poor</strong> – Those who are definitely poor and ask for help</li>
                <li><strong>The Needy</strong> – Those who are poor, but do not ask for help</li>
                <li><strong>Those employed to administer the Zakah</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Newly converted Muslims</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Slaves</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Those in debt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Wayfarers</strong> – Travelers who are cut off from their own resources</li>
                <li><strong>Those in the path of Allah</strong> – Muslims who are fighting or teaching for Allah</li>
            </ul>
